### Nice to meet you 🙂 I'm Naomi

I'm a Software & Solution Developer @ [Quick Release](https://github.com/QuickRelease) - mostly full stack utilising the Django framework for web development 👩‍💻 But my main passion is UI/UX - creating distinctive design and templates across tools

#### Some things I have done that I am proud of 🦚

- A small feature where I created a dynamic dropdown using [Select2](https://select2.org/) which added a colour icon to the options. When selected, the option then condensed to only show that coloured icon! This meant that the dropdown wasn't overly cluttered with information <img src="/dropdown.gif" height="200"/>

- I am really proud of my contribution to [Stigma Statistics](https://www.stigmastats.co.uk/) - developing a Django web application to collate and map suicide data to uncover prevention insights 

- I wrote an article about [Best Practice for Pull Requests](https://medium.com/@naomicrosthwaite/quality-reviews-best-practice-to-pull-requests-8973b44f45e8) as an outcome to an internal workstream about Pull Request Culture. I really enjoyed writing it, and I am motivated to write more articles from my experience and outlook 📝

⚡ Outside of work I enjoy upcycling furniture, spinning and going for walks
